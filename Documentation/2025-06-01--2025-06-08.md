## Tasks for This Week:

- Magnetometer integration and testing
- Additional encoder installation
- Complete hardware integration
- Multi-component system testing

## Work Progress:

### Complete Hardware Integration
- ✅ **Magnetometer Addition**: Successfully integrated QMC5883L via I2C-4 (GPIO20/21)
- ✅ **Second Encoder**: Added time control encoder via I2C-5 (GPIO5/6)
- ✅ **Multi-Device Testing**: All three I2C components working simultaneously

### System Architecture Finalized
- **Power Management**: All components powered via breadboard from Pi pins 1 & 6
- **I2C Bus Allocation**: Three separate software I2C buses avoiding conflicts
- **Device Addressing**: Confirmed unique I2C addresses for all components

### Hardware Component Summary
| Component         | I2C Bus | GPIO Pins | Physical Pins | Address | Function              | 3.3V Pin | GND Pin |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------------------|----------|---------|
| Distance Encoder  | I2C-3   | GPIO23/24 | 16/18         | 0x36    | Distance control      | Pin 1    | Pin 6   |
| Magnetometer      | I2C-4   | GPIO20/21 | 38/40         | 0x0D    | Direction sensing     | Pin 1    | Pin 6   |
| Time Encoder      | I2C-5   | GPIO5/6   | 29/31         | 0x36    | Time offset control   | Pin 1    | Pin 6   |

### Next Phase Preparation
- Hardware integration complete - ready for software workflow development
- All electronic components tested and functional
- System ready for ML model integration phase
