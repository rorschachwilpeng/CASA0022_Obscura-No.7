## Tasks for This Week:

- Magnetometer integration and testing
- Additional encoder installation
- Complete hardware integration
- Multi-component system testing

## Work Progress:

### Complete Hardware Integration
- ✅ **Magnetometer Addition**: Successfully integrated QMC5883L via I2C-4 (GPIO20/21)
- ✅ **Second Encoder**: Added time control encoder via I2C-5 (GPIO5/6)
- ✅ **Multi-Device Testing**: All three I2C components working simultaneously

### System Architecture Finalized
- **Power Management**: All components powered via breadboard from Pi pins 1 & 6
- **I2C Bus Allocation**: Three separate software I2C buses avoiding conflicts
- **Device Addressing**: Confirmed unique I2C addresses for all components

### Hardware Component Summary
| Component | I2C Bus | GPIO Pins | Address | Function |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Distance Encoder | I2C-3 | GPIO23/24 | 0x36 | Distance control |
| Magnetometer | I2C-4 | GPIO20/21 | 0x0D | Direction sensing |
| Time Encoder | I2C-5 | GPIO5/6 | 0x36 | Time offset control |

### Next Phase Preparation
- Hardware integration complete - ready for software workflow development
- All electronic components tested and functional
- System ready for ML model integration phase
