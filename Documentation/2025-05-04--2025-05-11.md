# 2025/05/04--2025/05/11

## Tasks for This Week:

- Hardware procurement research and component selection
- Raspberry Pi 4 setup and initialization
- Basic development environment configuration
- Initial API integration planning

## Work Progress:

### Hardware Setup Achievements
- ✅ **Raspberry Pi Initialization Complete**: Successfully set up headless Raspberry Pi with SSH access
- ✅ **Remote Access Configured**: Established stable SSH connection (ssh youtianpeng@obscuraNo7-RPi.local)
- ✅ **Basic Script Development**: Created initial Python script for OpenWeather and OpenAI API integration
- ✅ **File Transfer Setup**: Configured SCP for code deployment to Raspberry Pi

### Technical Discoveries
- **Memory Limitation**: Initial 1GB Raspberry Pi insufficient, upgraded to lab's higher-capacity unit
- **API Integration Success**: Successfully tested weather data retrieval and AI image generation pipeline
- **Development Workflow**: Established local development → Raspberry Pi deployment process

### Challenges Identified
- Need for electronic display screen testing
- GPS module requirement identified for location services
- Additional control components needed (encoders, buttons)
