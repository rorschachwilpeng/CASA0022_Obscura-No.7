# 2025/06/15--2025/06/22

## Tasks for This Week:
- Finalize Task 1.4: Website front-end and modal refactor.
- Complete Task 1.5: End-to-end integration testing of full cloud workflow.
- Deploy updated site to Render and validate performance.
- Prepare groundwork for Task 1.6 (Raspberry Pi integration).

## Work Progress:

### Website Front-end Refactor (Task 1.4)
- Re-designed image modal with dual-section layout (image + data) for improved readability on exhibition screens.
- Unified steampunk UI theme: revised CSS variables, typography, borders and decorative elements; added prominent "✕" close button.
- Fixed Gallery ↔ Modal event binding issues; implemented `forceRebindAllEvents()` with MutationObserver to guarantee click handlers across dynamic loads.

### End-to-End Integration Testing (Task 1.5)
- Created automated script suite under `test/end_to_end_testing` to simulate Raspberry Pi input and trigger cloud workflow.
- Validated chain: API call → ML prediction → AI image generation → website display.
- Achieved single-request latency < 0.25 s and passed 3-concurrency stress test.
- Produced test summary report and API documentation for future Pi integration.

### Deployment & Maintenance
- Added version query strings to all JS assets to overcome browser cache issues.
- Fixed "Detailed Analysis" navigation and missing `gallery.js` reference; site now renders images correctly on Render.
- Cleaned obsolete branch `test-original-modal`; main branch remains up-to-date.

### Next Week Preview
- Begin Task 1.6: adapt Raspberry Pi scripts to consume cloud APIs.
- Refine magnetometer + encoder interaction mapping to coordinate calculation module.
