# 2025/06/29--2025/07/06

## Tasks for This Week:
- Develop comprehensive ML environmental prediction framework
- Complete hardware-cloud AI workflow integration 
- Deploy and test ML model integration
- Conduct supervisor meeting for environmental variable selection
- Establish multi-dimensional environmental data collection system

## Work Progress:

### Key Accomplishments:
- **ML Framework Development**: Successfully created comprehensive environmental prediction framework with three core dimensions:
  - **Meteorological & Climate Factors**: Temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, NO2 levels
  - **Human Activity & Socioeconomic Factors**: Population distribution, life expectancy, rail infrastructure 
  - **Geospatial & Topographic Factors**: Geology/soil properties, hydrological networks, urban flood risk, vegetation/water health
- **Data Collection Pipeline**: Established automated data collection system with 140,000+ environmental data points across multiple categories
- **Model Integration**: Completed deployment of lightweight ML prediction model with cloud API integration
- **Hardware-Cloud Workflow**: Achieved end-to-end integration from Raspberry Pi hardware interface to cloud-based prediction and web visualization
- **Academic Consultation**: Conducted supervisor meeting on July 3rd to finalize environmental variable selection framework

### Technical Implementations:
- **Data Sources**: Integrated Open-Meteo APIs, demographic datasets, and infrastructure data
- **Model Deployment**: Deployed `simple_environmental_model.pkl` with RESTful API endpoints
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Enhanced telescope workflow with comprehensive environmental data processing
- **Quality Assurance**: Implemented complete workflow testing and validation systems

### Next Phase Planning:
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune ML model performance and accuracy
- **3D Physical Components**: Finalize telescope mounting system and interactive hardware design
- **System Integration**: Complete full-scale testing and deployment preparation
- **Exhibition Setup**: Prepare for final installation and demonstration phase
