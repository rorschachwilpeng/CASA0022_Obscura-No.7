## 💡 **Supervisor Recommendations**

### **Report Structure & Content**:
1. **Enclosure Design Documentation**: Remove detailed modeling flowcharts from final report, upload to GitHub repository with brief mention and link in dissertation
2. **Project Positioning**: Redefine as "Speculative Interface for Environmental Discourse" rather than educational tool
3. **Future Work Strategy**: Focus on most critical and extensible aspects rather than covering all objectives
4. **Methodology Enhancement**: Include failed attempts and technical iterations to demonstrate engineering judgment
5. **User Feedback Interpretation**: Acknowledge indirect and delayed environmental awareness activation

### **Academic Framework**:
1. **Three-Hypothesis Structure**: Maintain consistency across all chapters (Introduction → Literature Review → Methodology → Result → Reflection → Conclusion)
2. **Longitudinal Study Proposal**: Encourage future research to track delayed environmental awareness activation
3. **Technical Iteration Documentation**: Include hardware compatibility issues and model stability challenges
