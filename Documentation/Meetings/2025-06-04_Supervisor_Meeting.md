## üîß Current Hardware Architecture Review

| Component | Current Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 | Main controller, system operation, display control | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| HyperPixel Display | AI-generated image visualization | ‚úÖ Integrated |
| Encoder √ó2 | ‚ë† Time prediction control ‚ë° Generation trigger | ‚úÖ Testing |
| GPS Module | Location detection | ‚ùå **Abandoned** |
| Magnetometer (Planned) | Direction sensing for interaction expansion | üìã **New Addition** |

## ‚ùå GPS Module Abandonment Decision

### **Reasons for Abandonment**:
- **Indoor Signal Issues**: GPS extremely difficult to acquire indoors
- **Exhibition Environment**: Indoor graduation exhibition space = GPS usability ‚âà 0
- **User Experience**: Unreliable positioning would compromise interaction quality

### **Alternative Solutions Discussed**:

#### **Option 1: Flutter App GPS Integration**
- ‚úÖ **Advantages**: Utilize phone GPS ‚Üí Bluetooth transmission to Raspberry Pi
- ‚ùå **Problems**: 
  - Multi-platform user devices (non-Android users excluded)
  - Exhibition user reluctance to download apps
  - High interaction barrier

## üåê **Supervisor Recommendation: Web-Based Solution**

| Recommendation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ **Web Interface** | Cross-platform access, no download required |
| ‚úÖ **HTML5 Geolocation** | Browser-based location services via HTML5 + JavaScript |
| ‚úÖ **Web-Device Communication** | Explore: WebSocket / Web Bluetooth / NFC Tag technologies |

---

## üß≠ **Magnetometer Interaction Concept (Key Breakthrough)**

### **Core Concept**: 
Users rotate the telescope device in place ‚Üí Simulate "switching geographic locations" to view future scenarios

### **Interaction Design**:
- **Encoder Control**: Observation distance/zoom level
- **Magnetometer Control**: Observation direction/geographic location
- **Local Generation**: System generates corresponding scenarios ‚Üí Display on HyperPixel

### **üéØ Advantages**:
- Eliminates GPS and Bluetooth dependencies
- Strong interactivity with intuitive exhibition experience
- Aligns with "directional telescope" concept, fitting artistic narrative

## üì° **Alternative Technology Options Discussed**

| Technology | Description | Feasibility |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| NFC Tag | Near-field communication triggers | ‚ùå Limited range |
| Web Bluetooth | Browser-device Bluetooth communication | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support |
| Web Serial/USB | Chrome browser serial/USB communication | ‚ö†Ô∏è Security authorization required |

**Note**: Supervisor questioned necessity of rotation data synchronization with web interface

## üß† **Academic vs Product Development Positioning**

### **Student Concern**: 
"Is this project too focused on product development rather than academic research?"

### **Supervisor Response**:
- ‚úÖ **Core Focus**: Clear research question definition is essential
- ‚úÖ **Development Process**: Product-like development acceptable if academic writing maintains logical structure
- ‚úÖ **Strategy**: "Non-linear R&D + Linear Writing" approach
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Exploration of motivation during process, unified structural presentation in final report

---

## üìå **Next Steps & Action Items**

| Module | Recommended Actions |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Magnetometer** | Confirm Raspberry Pi compatible modules, data reading methods |
| **Interaction Design** | Combine Encoder + Magnetometer interaction logic |
| **Display Logic** | Synchronize image generation with direction/distance changes |
| **Visualization** | Consider local HTML/WebSocket for position switching display |

---

## üîÑ **Key Decisions Made**

1. **GPS Module ‚Üí Magnetometer**: Enable rotation-based interaction for different location viewing
2. **Flutter App ‚Üí Web Platform**: Avoid exhibition accessibility issues with cross-platform web solution
3. **Enhanced Interaction**: Direction (rotation) + Distance (zoom) + Time controls for comprehensive future scenario exploration

---

## üìù **Meeting Outcome**

The meeting successfully resolved major technical and conceptual challenges, pivoting from GPS-dependent location services to magnetometer-based directional interaction. This change transforms the project from "limited to current location" to "standing here but seeing far distant places" - a significant conceptual enhancement aligning with the telescope metaphor.

The web-based approach eliminates technical barriers while maintaining the core interactive experience, making the installation more accessible for exhibition visitors.
