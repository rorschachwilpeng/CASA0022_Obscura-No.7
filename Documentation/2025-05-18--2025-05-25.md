## Tasks for This Week:

- GPS module testing and evaluation
- HyperPixel display integration attempts
- 3D modeling preparation and research
- Hardware component integration planning

## Work Progress:

### Hardware Integration Attempts
- **GPS Module Testing**: Encountered significant difficulties with indoor signal reception
- **HyperPixel Display Issues**: Initial integration attempt failed, suspected hardware damage
- **3D Modeling Initiation**: Downloaded base telescope model for enclosure development

### Critical Decisions
- **GPS Module Concerns**: Indoor signal weakness raising feasibility questions
- **Display Replacement**: Planning HyperPixel replacement due to integration failure
- **Alternative Location Services**: Considering app-based GPS data acquisition

### Technical Challenges
- Android device requirement for app-based solution limiting user accessibility
- Need for cross-platform location service solution
