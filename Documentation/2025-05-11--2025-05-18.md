## Tasks for This Week:

- Electronic component procurement and testing
- I2C peripheral feasibility experiments
- GPIO expansion planning
- Hardware integration research

## Work Progress:

### Hardware Expansion Planning
- **I2C Extension Research**: Investigated feasibility of external I2C device connections
- **Component Identification**: Determined need for:
  - GPS module for location services
  - 3x rotary encoders for user controls
  - 1x generation button
  - GPIO expansion board for additional connections

### Development Challenges
- **Component Availability**: Waiting for encoder deliveries
- **Circuit Design**: Planning GPIO expansion board integration
- **Testing Preparation**: Preparing for multi-component integration testing
