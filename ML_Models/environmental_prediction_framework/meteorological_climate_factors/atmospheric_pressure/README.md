# ðŸŒ€ Atmospheric Pressure Data

## Overview
Atmospheric pressure data measures the weight of air at different locations and altitudes, essential for weather prediction, climate analysis, and understanding atmospheric dynamics.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: Open-Meteo Historical Weather API
- **URL**: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api?latitude=51.5085&longitude=-0.1257&hourly=surface_pressure
- **Coverage**: Historical weather data with high temporal resolution
- **Spatial Resolution**: Point-based data for London coordinates (51.5085Â°N, -0.1257Â°W)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly data availability
- **Format**: JSON, CSV

## Data Description

### Pressure Variables
- **Surface Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure at sea level
- **Station Pressure**: Pressure at observation site elevation
- **Pressure Tendency**: Rate of pressure change over time
- **Pressure Gradients**: Spatial differences in pressure

### Data Characteristics
- **Geographic Focus**: London metropolitan area
- **Temporal Coverage**: Historical data available from 1940 onwards
- **Data Quality**: High-resolution meteorological reanalysis data
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time data with historical archives
- **Units**: Pressure in hPa (hectopascals) or mbar (millibars)

## Environmental Significance
Atmospheric pressure data is essential for:
- Weather forecasting and storm tracking
- Aviation safety and flight planning
- Climate pattern analysis (high/low pressure systems)
- Wind pattern prediction
- Barometric altitude measurements
- Health impact studies (pressure-sensitive conditions)
- Marine navigation and tidal predictions

## Data Processing Notes
- Standard sea level pressure is 1013.25 hPa
- Consider altimeter settings for aviation applications
- Quality control includes pressure range validation
- Temporal filtering may be required for trend analysis
- Account for diurnal pressure variations

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Data Access**: Use Open-Meteo API with London coordinates
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply temporal smoothing and altitude corrections
3. **Quality Checks**: Validate pressure ranges and temporal consistency
4. **Integration**: Combine with wind and temperature data for synoptic analysis

## Related Variables
- Wind speed (driven by pressure gradients)
- Temperature (affects pressure through thermal expansion)
- Humidity (water vapor affects air density)
- Sea level (pressure affects sea level through inverse barometer effect)
