# üå°Ô∏è Temperature Data

## Overview
Temperature data is a fundamental meteorological variable that includes air temperature, surface water temperature, and water column temperature measurements. This data is crucial for understanding thermal dynamics and climate patterns.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: UK Met Office Climate Data
- **URL**: https://climate-themetoffice.hub.arcgis.com/search?tags=temperature
- **Coverage**: Historical data from 1991-2020
- **Spatial Resolution**: National and regional coverage for the UK
- **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly and seasonal averages
- **Format**: NetCDF, CSV, GeoJSON

## Data Description

### Temperature Variables
- **Air Temperature**: Surface air temperature at 2m height
- **Surface Water Temperature**: Water surface temperature for rivers and lakes
- **Water Column Temperature**: Temperature profiles in water bodies
- **Maximum Temperature**: Daily maximum temperature records
- **Minimum Temperature**: Daily minimum temperature records
- **Average Temperature**: Mean daily temperature values

### Data Characteristics
- **Temporal Coverage**: 1991-2020 (30-year climatology)
- **Geographic Focus**: London and surrounding regions
- **Data Quality**: High-quality observational data from Met Office stations
- **Update Frequency**: Historical data (no real-time updates)

## Environmental Significance
Temperature data is essential for:
- Climate change assessment and trend analysis
- Urban heat island effect studies
- Ecosystem health monitoring
- Agricultural planning and crop yield predictions
- Energy demand forecasting
- Public health impact assessments

## Data Processing Notes
- Temperature values are typically in Celsius (¬∞C)
- Data may require spatial interpolation for specific locations
- Quality control includes outlier detection and missing value handling
- Consider seasonal variations and long-term trends

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Data Access**: Download from Met Office Climate Data Portal
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply spatial and temporal aggregation as needed
3. **Quality Checks**: Validate temperature ranges and seasonal patterns
4. **Integration**: Combine with other meteorological variables for comprehensive analysis

## Related Variables
- Humidity (temperature affects moisture-holding capacity)
- Solar radiation (primary driver of temperature variations)
- Precipitation (temperature influences precipitation patterns)
