# üå¨Ô∏è Wind Speed Data

## Overview
Wind speed data provides measurements of atmospheric motion at various heights, essential for understanding weather patterns, energy applications, and environmental dispersion modeling.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: Open-Meteo Historical Weather API
- **URL**: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api?latitude=51.5085&longitude=-0.1257&hourly=wind_speed_10m
- **Coverage**: Historical weather data with high temporal resolution
- **Spatial Resolution**: Point-based data for London coordinates (51.5085¬∞N, -0.1257¬∞W)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly data availability
- **Format**: JSON, CSV

## Data Description

### Wind Variables
- **Wind Speed 10m**: Wind speed at 10 meters above ground level
- **Wind Direction**: Wind direction in degrees (0-360¬∞)
- **Wind Gusts**: Maximum wind speed over short periods
- **Wind Components**: U (east-west) and V (north-south) components

### Data Characteristics
- **Geographic Focus**: London metropolitan area
- **Temporal Coverage**: Historical data available from 1940 onwards
- **Data Quality**: High-resolution meteorological reanalysis data
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time data with historical archives
- **Units**: Wind speed in m/s or km/h, direction in degrees

## Environmental Significance
Wind speed data is essential for:
- Weather forecasting and storm prediction
- Wind energy resource assessment
- Air quality and pollution dispersion modeling
- Urban planning and building design
- Aviation and transportation safety
- Agricultural applications (crop protection)
- Climate change impact studies

## Data Processing Notes
- Wind speed values are typically positive (speed is magnitude)
- Consider wind direction for vector analysis
- Account for surface roughness effects in urban areas
- Quality control includes validation of extreme values
- Temporal averaging may be required for specific applications

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Data Access**: Use Open-Meteo API with London coordinates
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply temporal aggregation and directional analysis
3. **Quality Checks**: Validate wind speed ranges and directional consistency
4. **Integration**: Combine with pressure gradients and temperature data

## Related Variables
- Atmospheric pressure (pressure gradients drive wind)
- Temperature (thermal gradients create wind patterns)
- Precipitation (wind affects precipitation distribution)
- Solar radiation (creates thermal gradients)
