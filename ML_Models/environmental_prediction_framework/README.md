# üåç Environmental Prediction Framework for CASA0022 Obscura No.7

## Overview
This framework provides a comprehensive data structure for environmental prediction modeling, organized into three primary dimensions that capture the complex interactions between natural systems and human activities.

## Framework Structure

### 1. üå§Ô∏è Meteorological & Climate Factors
Core atmospheric and climate variables that directly influence environmental conditions:
- **Temperature** (Air temperature, surface water temperature, water column temperature)
- **Humidity** (Relative humidity, absolute humidity)
- **Wind Speed** (Surface wind patterns, directional components)
- **Atmospheric Pressure** (Surface pressure, pressure gradients)
- **Solar Radiation** (Direct, diffuse, and reflected radiation)
- **Precipitation** (Intensity, accumulation, duration, patterns)
- **Sea Level** (Mean sea level, tidal variations)

### 2. üèôÔ∏è Human Activities & Socioeconomic Factors
Anthropogenic influences and societal indicators:
- **Land Use/Land Cover** (Urban development, agriculture, forestry, water bodies)
- **Population Distribution** (Density, demographics, migration patterns)
- **Economic Activity Indicators** (GDP, GVA, industrial activity)
- **Infrastructure** (Railway networks, transportation density)
- **Social Indicators** (Life expectancy, health metrics)

### 3. üèîÔ∏è Geospatial & Topographic Factors
Geographic and terrain characteristics:
- **Hydrological Network** (River density, drainage systems)
- **Geology & Soil** (Soil types, depth, geological composition)
- **Vegetation & Water Health** (NDVI, NDWI, ecosystem indicators)
- **Urban Flood Risk** (Flood zones, drainage capacity)

## Data Integration Strategy

### Input Data Sources
- **Current Weather Data**: OpenWeather API integration
- **Socioeconomic Data**: Geographic coordinate-based location mapping
- **Historical Datasets**: Long-term environmental and societal trends

### Output Predictions
Machine learning models will predict future multidimensional environmental conditions based on:
- Temporal patterns and trends
- Spatial correlations and dependencies
- Cross-domain interactions between meteorological, human, and geographic factors

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Data Collection**: Each subfolder contains specific data sources and collection methods
2. **Processing**: Standardized data preprocessing for model compatibility
3. **Integration**: Multi-dimensional data fusion for comprehensive environmental modeling
4. **Prediction**: Time-series forecasting and spatial prediction capabilities

## Data Quality Standards
- **Temporal Coverage**: Minimum 5-year historical data
- **Spatial Resolution**: Local to regional scale (London focus)
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time to monthly depending on data type
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and quality checks

## Contributing
Each data category includes detailed documentation on sources, formats, and processing requirements. Follow the established structure when adding new data sources or variables.
