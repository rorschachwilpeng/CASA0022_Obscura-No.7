# ðŸ“Š Life Expectancy Data

## Overview
Life expectancy data provides measurements of average lifespan at birth, serving as a comprehensive indicator of population health, environmental quality, and socioeconomic conditions.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: UK Met Office Climate Data Portal

- **Coverage**: Life expectancy at birth from UK Climate Resilience Programme UK-SSPs project
- **Spatial Resolution**: Office for National Statistics Local Authority District (ONS LAD) level
- **Temporal Resolution**: Projections from 2020-2100
- **Format**: GeoJSON, CSV

## Data Description

### Life Expectancy Variables
- **Life Expectancy at Birth**: Average years of life expectancy for newborns
- **Gender-specific Life Expectancy**: Separate measures for males and females
- **Age-specific Life Expectancy**: Life expectancy at different ages
- **Healthy Life Expectancy**: Years of life in good health
- **Mortality Rates**: Age-specific death rates by region

### Data Characteristics
- **Geographic Focus**: Local Authority Districts including London
- **Temporal Coverage**: 2020-2100 projections
- **Data Quality**: UK Climate Resilience Programme demographic projections
- **Update Frequency**: Long-term projections updated periodically
- **Units**: Life expectancy in years

## Environmental Significance
Life expectancy data is essential for:
- Environmental health impact assessment
- Air quality and pollution health effect studies
- Climate change health vulnerability analysis
- Urban environmental quality evaluation
- Environmental justice and equity studies
- Public health policy development
- Sustainable development indicator monitoring

## Data Processing Notes
- Life expectancy values are continuous and positive
- Consider demographic transition scenarios
- Account for health system improvements and challenges
- Quality control includes demographic validation
- Spatial aggregation may be required for environmental health analysis

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Data Access**: Download from Met Office Climate Data Portal
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply demographic scenario selection and spatial aggregation
3. **Quality Checks**: Validate life expectancy trends and demographic consistency
4. **Integration**: Combine with environmental quality and socioeconomic data for health impact analysis

## Related Variables
- Environmental quality (air/water quality affects health outcomes)
- Economic activity (socioeconomic status affects health)
- Population distribution (urban/rural health disparities)
- Climate factors (temperature and weather affect health)
