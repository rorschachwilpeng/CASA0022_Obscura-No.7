# ðŸ‘¥ Population Distribution Data

## Overview
Population distribution data includes population density, total population, and demographic characteristics, providing insights into human settlement patterns and their environmental impacts.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: UK Met Office Climate Data Portal
- **URL**: https://climate-themetoffice.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/7307e591bdf7439aafdb56a2ede245c8_2/explore
- **Coverage**: Population age structure projections from UK Climate Resilience Programme UK-SSPs project
- **Spatial Resolution**: Office for National Statistics Local Authority District (ONS LAD) level
- **Temporal Resolution**: Projections from 2020-2100
- **Format**: GeoJSON, CSV

## Data Description

### Population Variables
- **Total Population**: Total number of residents per area
- **Population Density**: People per square kilometer
- **Age Structure**: Population distribution by age groups (thousands per age class)
- **Demographic Projections**: Future population scenarios
- **Migration Patterns**: Population movement trends

### Data Characteristics
- **Geographic Focus**: Local Authority Districts including London
- **Temporal Coverage**: 2020-2100 projections
- **Data Quality**: UK Climate Resilience Programme projections
- **Update Frequency**: Long-term projections updated periodically
- **Units**: Population in thousands, density in people/kmÂ²

## Environmental Significance
Population distribution data is essential for:
- Urban environmental pressure assessment
- Infrastructure demand planning
- Air quality and pollution exposure studies
- Water resource consumption modeling
- Waste generation and management planning
- Energy demand forecasting
- Climate change vulnerability analysis

## Data Processing Notes
- Population projections include uncertainty ranges
- Consider demographic transition scenarios
- Account for migration and urbanization trends
- Quality control includes demographic validation
- Spatial aggregation may be required for different scales

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Data Access**: Download from Met Office Climate Data Portal
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply demographic scenario selection and spatial aggregation
3. **Quality Checks**: Validate population projections and demographic consistency
4. **Integration**: Combine with economic and land use data for comprehensive analysis

## Related Variables
- Economic activity (population drives economic demand)
- Land use (population density affects development patterns)
- Infrastructure (population determines service needs)
- Environmental quality (population affects resource consumption)
