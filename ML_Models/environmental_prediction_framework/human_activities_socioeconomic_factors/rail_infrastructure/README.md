# ðŸš‚ Rail Infrastructure Data

## Overview
Rail infrastructure data measures railway line density per area, providing insights into transportation development, connectivity, and its environmental impacts on regional development patterns.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: UK Met Office Climate Data Portal
- **URL**: https://climate-themetoffice.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dc25f1dd24d345f988ba812574223295_0/explore
- **Coverage**: Railway lines per area from UK Climate Resilience Programme UK-SSPs project
- **Spatial Resolution**: Office for National Statistics Local Authority District (ONS LAD) level
- **Temporal Resolution**: Projections from 2020-2100
- **Format**: GeoJSON, Shapefile

## Data Description

### Infrastructure Variables
- **Railway Line Density**: Length of railway lines per unit area (m/kmÂ²)
- **Network Connectivity**: Degree of rail network integration
- **Station Density**: Number of railway stations per area
- **Service Frequency**: Train service levels and capacity
- **Infrastructure Development**: New rail project developments

### Data Characteristics
- **Geographic Focus**: Local Authority Districts including London
- **Temporal Coverage**: 2020-2100 projections
- **Data Quality**: UK Climate Resilience Programme infrastructure data
- **Update Frequency**: Long-term projections updated periodically
- **Units**: Railway line density in meters per square kilometer (m/kmÂ²)

## Environmental Significance
Rail infrastructure data is essential for:
- Transportation emission modeling
- Land use development pattern analysis
- Urban sprawl and connectivity assessment
- Modal shift potential evaluation
- Climate change mitigation policy planning
- Sustainable transportation system design
- Regional economic development impact studies

## Data Processing Notes
- Infrastructure density values are continuous and non-negative
- Consider existing vs. planned infrastructure developments
- Account for service capacity and utilization rates
- Quality control includes infrastructure validation
- Spatial aggregation may be required for regional analysis

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Data Access**: Download from Met Office Climate Data Portal
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply spatial aggregation and density calculations
3. **Quality Checks**: Validate infrastructure density and network connectivity
4. **Integration**: Combine with population and economic data for accessibility analysis

## Related Variables
- Population distribution (rail infrastructure serves populated areas)
- Economic activity (transportation supports economic development)
- Land use (infrastructure affects development patterns)
- Environmental quality (transport affects air quality and emissions)
