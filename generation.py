## 🎨 Project Vision

Obscura No.7 transforms the traditional concept of observation by enabling users to "see" future environmental conditions through AI-generated artistic interpretations. By combining physical interaction (distance, direction, time controls) with machine learning predictions and generative AI, the installation creates an immersive experience that bridges present reality with predicted futures.

The project serves both as an interactive art piece and a research platform for exploring human-AI collaboration in environmental prediction and artistic expression.

## 📋 Meeting Details
- **Date**: June 4, 2025
- **Project**: Obscura No.7
- **Participants**: Student, Supervisor Valerio
- **Topic**: Hardware Architecture, Interaction Methods & Research Positioning

---

## 🔧 Current Hardware Architecture Review

| Component | Current Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 | Main controller, system operation, display control | ✅ Implemented |
| HyperPixel Display | AI-generated image visualization | ✅ Integrated |
| Encoder ×2 | ① Time prediction control ② Generation trigger | ✅ Testing |
| GPS Module | Location detection | ❌ **Abandoned** |
| Magnetometer (Planned) | Direction sensing for interaction expansion | 📋 **New Addition** |

---

## ❌ GPS Module Abandonment Decision

### **Reasons for Abandonment**:
- **Indoor Signal Issues**: GPS extremely difficult to acquire indoors
- **Exhibition Environment**: Indoor graduation exhibition space = GPS usability ≈ 0
- **User Experience**: Unreliable positioning would compromise interaction quality

### **Alternative Solutions Discussed**:

#### **Option 1: Flutter App GPS Integration**
- ✅ **Advantages**: Utilize phone GPS → Bluetooth transmission to Raspberry Pi
- ❌ **Problems**: 
  - Multi-platform user devices (non-Android users excluded)
  - Exhibition user reluctance to download apps
  - High interaction barrier

---

## 🌐 **Supervisor Recommendation: Web-Based Solution**

| Recommendation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Web Interface** | Cross-platform access, no download required |
| ✅ **HTML5 Geolocation** | Browser-based location services via HTML5 + JavaScript |
| ✅ **Web-Device Communication** | Explore: WebSocket / Web Bluetooth / NFC Tag technologies |

---

## 🧭 **Magnetometer Interaction Concept (Key Breakthrough)**

### **Core Concept**: 
Users rotate the telescope device in place → Simulate "switching geographic locations" to view future scenarios

### **Interaction Design**:
- **Encoder Control**: Observation distance/zoom level
- **Magnetometer Control**: Observation direction/geographic location
- **Local Generation**: System generates corresponding scenarios → Display on HyperPixel

### **🎯 Advantages**:
- Eliminates GPS and Bluetooth dependencies
- Strong interactivity with intuitive exhibition experience
- Aligns with "directional telescope" concept, fitting artistic narrative

---

## 📡 **Alternative Technology Options Discussed**

| Technology | Description | Feasibility |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| NFC Tag | Near-field communication triggers | ❌ Limited range |
| Web Bluetooth | Browser-device Bluetooth communication | ⚠️ Limited support |
| Web Serial/USB | Chrome browser serial/USB communication | ⚠️ Security authorization required |

**Note**: Supervisor questioned necessity of rotation data synchronization with web interface

---

## 🧠 **Academic vs Product Development Positioning**

### **Student Concern**: 
"Is this project too focused on product development rather than academic research?"

### **Supervisor Response**:
- ✅ **Core Focus**: Clear research question definition is essential
- ✅ **Development Process**: Product-like development acceptable if academic writing maintains logical structure
- ✅ **Strategy**: "Non-linear R&D + Linear Writing" approach
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Exploration of motivation during process, unified structural presentation in final report

---

## 📌 **Next Steps & Action Items**

| Module | Recommended Actions |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Magnetometer** | Confirm Raspberry Pi compatible modules, data reading methods |
| **Interaction Design** | Combine Encoder + Magnetometer interaction logic |
| **Display Logic** | Synchronize image generation with direction/distance changes |
| **Visualization** | Consider local HTML/WebSocket for position switching display |

---

## 🔄 **Key Decisions Made**

1. **GPS Module → Magnetometer**: Enable rotation-based interaction for different location viewing
2. **Flutter App → Web Platform**: Avoid exhibition accessibility issues with cross-platform web solution
3. **Enhanced Interaction**: Direction (rotation) + Distance (zoom) + Time controls for comprehensive future scenario exploration

---

## 📝 **Meeting Outcome**

The meeting successfully resolved major technical and conceptual challenges, pivoting from GPS-dependent location services to magnetometer-based directional interaction. This change transforms the project from "limited to current location" to "standing here but seeing far distant places" - a significant conceptual enhancement aligning with the telescope metaphor.

The web-based approach eliminates technical barriers while maintaining the core interactive experience, making the installation more accessible for exhibition visitors.
